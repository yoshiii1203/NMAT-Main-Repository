## Interpretation Tips
- Use IS_BEST_NMAT_RECORD = True for person-level trend analyses to avoid repeated-attempt inflation.
- Use IS_PLE_ANALYSIS_SAFE = True for conservative PLE-linked analyses.
- School Type_rec2_FINAL is the original school-type reference field; compare with UNI_TYPE for harmonization checks.
- For institution-level reporting, filter low-volume groups (e.g., n < 10) to reduce unstable percentages.
